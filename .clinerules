# .clinerules

1. Basics  
   - "namespace" = IRIS namespace  
   - "package" prefix = class prefix  
   - Do not create classes or properties with '%' or '_'
   - Class parameter names must not contain underscore ('_') characters - use camel case (e.g., "MyParameter") or all caps without underscores (e.g., "MYPARAM" or "MYPARAMETER") instead

2. Explicit Rules in Chat  
   - Any references to these rules (e.g. "(Ref:Write ObjectScript…)") must only appear in chat conversation, not in permanent source code files.

3. Write ObjectScript  
   - Return a %Status from methods that produce no return value.  
   - First line: Set tSC = $$$OK  
   - Last line: Quit tSC  
   - Use try/catch for error trapping  
   - Use doc comment banners with HTML/DocBook markup
   - CRITICAL: ObjectScript macro syntax must use triple dollar signs ($$$) not double ($$)
   - If encountering multiple $$ syntax errors in a file, use write_to_file for full replacement rather than multiple replace_in_file operations

4. Editing Files  
   - Seek user approval before editing Markdown outside memory-bank/.  
   - Only modify .cls files within src/MA or src/MALIB.
   - When replace_in_file fails to resolve typos or syntax errors, use write_to_file for full file replacement
   - Use full file replacement (write_to_file) when multiple syntax corrections are needed to avoid cascading errors
   - CRITICAL: Always use write_to_file for $ vs $$ macro syntax fixes - never use replace_in_file for these issues

5. InterSystems Libraries  
   - Use built-in IRIS classes/packages for performance and maintainability.

6. Naming Conventions  
   - Parameters have "p" prefix (e.g., pItem).  
   - Local variables have "t" prefix (e.g., tIndex).  
   - Class properties are capitalized with no prefix.
   - Class Parameters must be accessed using the # character (e.g., ..#PARAMETERNAME).

7. Comments  
   - Semicolon for single-line comments  
   - Class/Method banners must have HTML & DocBook markup

8. Additional Rules in Memory Bank
   - Follow the additional rules found in the memory bank.   In particular observe the rules in memory-bank/permanent/objectscriptrules.md

9. Indentation and Formatting
   - Always indent ObjectScript commands within methods by at least 1 space or tab to avoid compile errors.
   - Ensure each code block is consistently spaced to maintain readability and proper compilation in IRIS.
   - When editing ObjectScript class files, prefer reading the entire file then writing the full content back, rather than partial search-replace, to maintain indentation integrity.

10. Python Integration
   - Read documention/IRIS_Embedded_Python_Complete_Manual.md at the start of any session that intends to use Python
   - Prefer native ObjectScript for IRIS operations (globals, persistence, SQL, transactions)
   - Use embedded Python only for external library integration (OpenAI, NumPy, ML libraries, document processing)
   - Follow embedded Python patterns: %SYS.Python.Import() for libraries, [Language = python] for methods
   - Use 'import iris' bridge when calling IRIS from Python code
   - Maintain backward compatibility with mock implementations as fallbacks
   - CRITICAL: ##class(%SYS.Python).IsAvailable() does NOT exist - use ##class(%SYS.Python).GetPythonVersion() and check if it returns "Not Loaded"

Follow these guidelines for all future ObjectScript development. In the chat, you may reference a rule with a short note, but do not embed these references in the source code.

## Ensemble Architecture Guidance
- When creating Business Services or Business Operations in Ensemble, ensure method signatures exactly match the InterSystems-defined definitions, for example:
  • OnProcessInput(pInput As %RegisteredObject, Output pOutput As %RegisteredObject, ByRef pHint As %String).
  • OnMessage(pRequest As MyRequestClass, Output pResponse As MyResponseClass).
- Use custom classes extending Ens.Request/Ens.Response to handle data exchange between services and operations.
- Verify the proper IRIS adapter is specified on each Business Service/Operation (e.g., EnsLib.File.InboundAdapter, EnsLib.File.OutboundAdapter).
- Carefully implement synchronous vs. asynchronous flows depending on production requirements.
- Always confirm that the method arguments match the correct data types expected by Ensemble, to avoid signature errors.
- Thoroughly review the relevant built-in Ensemble classes (Ens.BusinessService, Ens.BusinessProcess, Ens.BusinessOperation) for method signatures and best practices before extending them.

## IRIS Session Access
- I do NOT have access to IRIS session terminal or direct IRIS command execution
- Any IRIS commands (like "iris session iris -U OPTIRAG") must be executed by the user
- I can only read/write files and provide ObjectScript code for the user to execute
- When testing is needed, I should provide the specific ObjectScript commands for the user to run in their IRIS session

## Terminal Environment - Windows PowerShell
- Default VS Code terminal: Windows PowerShell (not Bash/cmd)
- Command chaining: Use semicolon (;) NOT double ampersand (&&)
- Correct PowerShell syntax: `cd path; command1; command2`
- Incorrect Bash syntax: `cd path && command1 && command2` (causes parser errors)
- Virtual environment activation: `venv\Scripts\activate` (backslash for Windows)
- Path separators: Use backslash (\) for Windows file paths
- CRITICAL: Always use PowerShell-compatible command syntax to avoid "token '&&' is not a valid statement separator" errors

## Research and Knowledge Resources
- Use Perplexity MCP as a reference source when uncertain about ObjectScript syntax, problem-solving approaches, or specification details
- Always research with Perplexity MCP before attempting solutions when knowledge is incomplete
- Consult Perplexity MCP for best practices, error resolution, and technical implementation guidance in ObjectScript and IRIS

## ObjectScript Collection and Object Handling
- CRITICAL: ObjectScript's $listbuild() and $list() functions serialize objects to strings, losing object identity
- When storing objects temporarily, use individual variables (Set obj1 = ..., Set obj2 = ...) rather than lists
- For unit tests, avoid $listbuild() when testing object properties - use direct object assignment instead
- Collection errors like "<INVALID OREF>" often indicate attempts to access serialized objects as if they were still objects
- When debugging collection issues, check for batch processing logic that may be accessing invalid object references

## Debugging and Error Resolution Patterns
- For "<INVALID OREF>" errors in collections: Look for object serialization issues or invalid object references in batch processing code
- For unit test failures with $ISOBJECT(): Check if objects are being stored in lists and losing object identity
- When multiple $ vs $$ syntax errors occur: Always use write_to_file for full replacement rather than multiple replace_in_file operations
- For complex ObjectScript debugging: Simplify architecture by eliminating unnecessary complexity (batch processing, complex collections) in favor of simple, reliable patterns
- Architecture principle: Choose reliability and maintainability over performance optimization when debugging complex issues

## IRIS Vector Search and Embedding Operations
- CRITICAL: Vector operations require exact datatype compatibility between query and stored embeddings
- Common SQL Error -259: "Cannot perform vector operation on vectors of different datatypes" indicates datatype mismatch
- SOLUTION: Use IRIS native embedding generation for query embeddings to match stored embedding types
- Pattern: Create temporary DocumentChunk with same MODEL parameter, use IRIS auto-embedding generation, extract result
- Vector search diagnostic approach: Create comprehensive diagnostic methods to isolate SQL query vs embedding generation issues
- Always use %Library.Embedding datatype for IRIS vector operations, not %Vector datatype
- Test vector operations with simple queries first, then complex semantic searches
- Realistic similarity scores for vector search: High relevance (0.6-0.8), Medium (0.3-0.6), Low (0.2-0.4)

- **JSON Response Structure**: Consistent structured responses {"status":"success","output":"...","namespace":"..."}
- **Namespace Isolation**: Proper $NAMESPACE switching and restoration for multi-namespace environments

### MCP Connectivity Debugging Patterns
- **Backend Validation First**: Always test IRIS classes directly (test_iris_class.py pattern) before MCP integration
- **MCP Protocol Isolation**: Test components separately - IRIS backend, MCP server startup, Cline connection
- **"Not Connected" Diagnosis**: Usually indicates Cline/VS Code extension issues, not server problems
- **Server Startup Validation**: Logs showing "IRIS connectivity test passed" + "STDIO server initialized" = server working
- **Extension Refresh Requirement**: Cline extension often needs disable/enable cycle after configuration changes
- **Absolute Path Requirements**: Use full paths to venv Python executable and script files in MCP configuration
