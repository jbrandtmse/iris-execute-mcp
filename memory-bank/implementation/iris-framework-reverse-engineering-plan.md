# IRIS Framework Reverse Engineering Plan
## %UnitTest and %Api Package Analysis for Enhanced MCP Integration

### 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive reverse engineering effort to analyze InterSystems IRIS's `%UnitTest` and `%Api` packages. The goal is to discover more effective patterns for exposing unit testing functionality through our MCP server, addressing current timeout issues and unlocking hidden capabilities.

**Current Challenge**: Our MCP unit testing implementation experiences 120-second timeouts during test execution via `%UnitTest.Manager.RunTest()`, suggesting we're not using optimal integration patterns.

**Expected Outcome**: A redesigned MCP unit testing interface that leverages IRIS's full testing framework capabilities with improved performance, reliability, and feature completeness.

### 2. Objectives

#### Primary Objectives
1. **Resolve Performance Issues**: Identify root cause of timeout problems and discover alternative execution patterns
2. **Enhance Functionality**: Uncover additional testing capabilities not currently exposed via MCP
3. **Optimize Integration**: Design more efficient MCP-to-IRIS communication patterns
4. **Future-Proof Architecture**: Establish patterns for leveraging other IRIS frameworks

#### Secondary Objectives
1. **Comprehensive API Mapping**: Document all available functionality in both packages
2. **Best Practices Discovery**: Identify recommended usage patterns from IRIS codebase
3. **Hidden Capabilities**: Find undocumented or lesser-known features
4. **Integration Opportunities**: Discover synergies between different framework components
