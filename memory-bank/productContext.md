# Product Context - IRIS Execute MCP Server

## Why This Project Exists

### The Problem
AI agents and developers need programmatic access to InterSystems IRIS functionality, but current solutions have limitations:
- Direct IRIS execution requires complex session management
- Unit testing in VS Code has severe sync issues with traditional approaches
- No standardized way to compile ObjectScript from external tools
- Limited ability to capture IRIS command output programmatically

### The Solution
A production-ready MCP server providing 8 essential tools for IRIS interaction:
- Direct ObjectScript command execution with output capture
- Global variable manipulation and retrieval
- Dynamic class method invocation
- ObjectScript compilation management
- Custom TestRunner-based unit testing with VS Code sync bypass
- Industry-standard Model Context Protocol integration

## User Experience Goals

### Primary Users
1. **AI Agents** (Claude, GPT-4, Cline, etc.)
   - Execute IRIS commands with real output capture
   - Compile and test ObjectScript code
   - Manage global variables programmatically
   - Run unit tests without sync issues

2. **Developers** integrating AI with IRIS
   - Rapid ObjectScript development and testing
   - Automated compilation workflows
   - Unit test execution with instant results
   - System monitoring and debugging

### Core User Journeys

**Journey 1: ObjectScript Development**
1. Developer writes ObjectScript code in IDE
2. Uses compile_objectscript_class to compile
3. Executes execute_unit_tests to run tests
4. Gets detailed pass/fail information in milliseconds
5. Iterates quickly with reliable test results

**Journey 2: System Debugging**
1. Developer needs to check system state
2. Uses execute_command to run diagnostic commands
3. Gets real output (not generic messages)
4. Uses get_global to inspect data structures
5. Uses execute_classmethod to test specific methods

**Journey 3: AI-Assisted Development**
1. AI agent helps write ObjectScript code
2. Compiles code using compilation tools
3. Runs unit tests with custom TestRunner
4. Provides instant feedback on test results
5. Iterates quickly without VS Code sync issues

### Configuration
```json
"iris-execute-mcp": {
  "command": "path/to/venv/Scripts/python.exe",
  "args": ["path/to/iris_execute_mcp.py"],
  "transportType": "stdio"
}
```
